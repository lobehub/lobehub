# Custom Plugins

## Installing Custom Plugins

If you'd like to install a plugin that isn't available in the LobeChat Plugin Store—such as one you've developed yourself—you can do so by clicking on "Custom Plugin":

LobeChat's plugin system is also compatible with ChatGPT plugins, allowing you to install them with a single click.

To try installing a custom plugin manually, you can use the following links:
