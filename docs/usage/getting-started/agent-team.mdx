# Agent Team

At LobeHub, you're free to create and customize your own AI assistants—whether it's a translation assistant that remembers your terminology preferences, a coding assistant familiar with your programming style, or a writing assistant that understands your tone and voice. By configuring prompts, selecting models, adding plugins, and linking knowledge bases, you can build a truly personalized assistant tailored to your needs.

This guide will walk you through how to create and configure your AI assistant in detail.

## Create a New AI Assistant

There are three ways to create a new assistant: use the Agent Builder for smart creation, build one from scratch, or quickly add one from the community. No matter which method you choose, your assistant can be fine-tuned to match your workflow.

### Smart Creation with Agent Builder

Agent Builder is LobeHub’s built-in assistant that helps you create AI assistants with ease. Simply chat with Agent Builder, describe your needs, and it will automatically generate a complete assistant configuration—including role settings, system prompts, and plugin setup.

- Click the "Create Assistant" button in the left sidebar on the homepage, or select "Create Agent" at the bottom of the chat window to get started.
- On the assistant profile page, chat with Agent Builder on the right side to describe your needs and complete the smart creation process.
- After the assistant is generated, you can still manually fine-tune the settings.

### Create a Custom Assistant

Creating a custom assistant gives you the most flexibility. You can personalize the assistant’s avatar, name, and prompts, and choose the AI model and plugins you want to use—crafting a truly unique AI assistant.

- Simply go to the assistant profile page and configure it manually.

### Add from the Community

If you want a ready-to-use assistant with a complete setup, you can add one directly from the community. The community offers a wide variety of high-quality assistants—design experts, coding helpers, copywriters, academic mentors, and more—ready to use with just one click.

- In the left sidebar on the homepage, go to "Community" → "Assistants", or scroll down the main interface to find "Community Assistants".
- Choose the assistant you want, click to view its details, and then click "Add Assistant and Start Chatting" to complete the setup.

## Configure Your AI Assistant

Once your assistant is created, you can enhance its capabilities by adding plugins and linking external workflows. Plugins provide extended functionality, while linking workflows allows your assistant to access and interact with your favorite tools. A more powerful assistant can significantly streamline your workflow.

### Edit Assistant Information

You can edit any aspect of your assistant at any time to keep it aligned with your evolving needs.

- Enter a conversation with the assistant, then click "Assistant Profile" in the left sidebar to make edits.

### Add Plugins and Link Tools

Adding plugins and connecting external tools can make your collaboration with the assistant more efficient.

- Enter a conversation with the assistant, then go to "Assistant Profile" → "+ Integrate Plugin" in the left sidebar.
