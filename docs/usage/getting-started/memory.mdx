# Memory

Traditional AI treats every conversation like the first time—you have to repeat the same information over and over. With the Agent Memory feature, your assistant truly gets to know you. It automatically identifies and remembers key information from your conversations, making each interaction more efficient and personalized.

This isn’t just a simple chat history—it’s intelligent knowledge extraction and organization. The assistant recognizes your identity, work context, personal preferences, and practical experience, and stores them in a structured format. In future conversations, it can proactively recall this memory to provide responses tailored to your needs—just like a colleague who really understands you.

## Understanding Agent Memory

Agent Memory is a built-in plugin in LobeHub. It automatically identifies and extracts key information from your conversations with the assistant, forming a structured memory base. These memories are proactively used in future interactions, making communication more personalized and efficient. Instead of merely recording dialogue, the assistant understands and extracts actionable memory instructions. In later conversations, it references relevant memories to provide more personalized responses, avoid asking for known information again, and tailor its output based on your preferences.

## Managing Memory

### Viewing Memory

Click the "Memory" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar on the LobeHub homepage to open the memory management panel. This panel displays all memories extracted from your conversations. Memories are organized by type for easy browsing and management. Each memory includes the following details:

- Memory Title: A concise summary of the memory’s core content, such as "Dislikes coffee".
- Preference Weight: Indicates the importance of the memory. The higher the weight, the more the assistant prioritizes it in conversations.
- Created Time: Shows when the memory was extracted from a conversation.
- Memory Instruction: The behavioral rule derived from the conversation, which the assistant follows in future interactions. For example: "Avoid recommending coffee or coffee-based drinks unless the user explicitly asks for them; suggest non-coffee alternatives instead."
- Possible Assistant Actions: Describes how the assistant might apply this memory, such as: "Offer tea, hot chocolate, juice, smoothies, or decaf/non-coffee options depending on context."
- Tags: Tags related to the memory for easier categorization and search.
