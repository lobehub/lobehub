# Agent

In LobeHub, you have the freedom to create and customize your own AI assistants—whether it's a translation assistant that remembers your terminology preferences, a coding assistant familiar with your programming style, or a writing assistant that understands your tone and voice. By configuring prompts, selecting models, adding plugins, and linking knowledge bases, you can build a truly personalized assistant tailored to your needs.

This guide will walk you through how to create and configure your AI assistant in detail.

## Create a New AI Assistant

There are three ways to create a new assistant: use the Agent Builder for smart creation, build one from scratch, or quickly add one from the community. No matter which method you choose, your assistant can be fine-tuned to match your workflow.

### Smart Creation with Agent Builder

Agent Builder is a built-in assistant in LobeHub that helps you create AI assistants effortlessly. Simply chat with Agent Builder and describe your needs—it will understand and automatically generate a complete assistant configuration, including role settings, system prompts, and plugin setups.

- Click the "Create Assistant" button in the left sidebar on the homepage, or select "Create Agent" below the chat box to get started.
- On the assistant profile page, chat with Agent Builder on the right side to describe your needs and complete the smart creation process.
- After the assistant is generated, you can still manually fine-tune the settings.

### Create a Custom Assistant

Creating a custom assistant gives you maximum flexibility. You can personalize the assistant’s avatar, name, and prompts, and choose the AI model and plugins you want to use—crafting a truly personal AI assistant.

- Simply go to the assistant profile page and configure everything manually.

### Add from the Community

If you want a ready-to-use assistant with a complete setup, you can add one directly from the community. The community offers a wide variety of high-quality assistants—design experts, coding helpers, copywriters, academic mentors, and more—ready to use with just one click.

- In the left sidebar on the homepage, go to "Community" → "Assistants", or scroll down the main interface to find "Community Assistants".
- Choose the assistant you want, click to view its details, and then click "Add Assistant and Start Chatting" to complete the process.

## Configure Your AI Assistant

Once your assistant is created, you can enhance its capabilities by adding plugins and linking external workflows. Plugins provide extended functionality, while external workflows allow your assistant to access and interact with your favorite tools. A more powerful AI assistant can significantly streamline your workflow.

### Edit Assistant Information

You can edit any information about your assistant at any time to keep it aligned with your evolving needs.

- Enter a conversation with the assistant, then click "Assistant Profile" in the left sidebar to edit.

### Add Plugins and Link Tools

Adding plugins and linking other tools can make your collaboration with the assistant more efficient.

- Enter a conversation with the assistant, then go to "Assistant Profile" → "+ Integrate Plugin" in the left sidebar.
