# Docs

LobeHub offers a professional writing space designed to help you focus on long-form content creation. Whether you're working on technical documentation, study notes, project proposals, or blog posts, the Docs feature has you covered. It supports Markdown formatting, provides real-time preview, and automatically saves every edit.

You can also summon your AI assistant at any time to collaborate on your writing. The assistant does more than just offer suggestions—it can directly edit your content, polish your writing, add paragraphs, optimize structure, and insert examples. Writing no longer has to be a solitary task—your AI assistant is like a writing partner, always ready to help you craft your next piece.

## Understanding the Docs Feature

Docs is LobeHub’s built-in writing environment, specifically designed for creating and editing long-form content. Unlike the chat feature, Docs offers:

### A Persistent Writing Space

Docs are saved independently, allowing you to return and continue editing at any time. Your content is saved permanently.

### Structured Content Organization

Full support for Markdown syntax lets you organize your content with headings, lists, code blocks, quotes, and more—perfect for creating professional-looking documents.

### Flexible File Management

Create, import, rename, duplicate—comprehensive file management tools help you efficiently organize all your documents.

## Creating and Importing Docs

### Create a New Doc

From the LobeHub main interface, go to “Docs” and click “New Doc,” or use the dropdown menu from the main interface’s new file icon to quickly create a document. Once created, you can start writing immediately. Your work is auto-saved, so you can close it anytime and pick up where you left off later.

### Import a Markdown File

If you already have a Markdown document, you can import it directly. In the Docs section, click “Upload Markdown File,” select your file, and it will be automatically loaded into a new document, ready for editing.

### Editing Docs

Docs are edited using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that uses simple symbols to format text, allowing you to focus on content. You can also add an icon above the document title, which will appear next to the title.

### Command Palette

While editing, press the / key to open the command palette—a quick-access tool that lets you insert various formatting elements with ease.\

### Collaborating with the AI Assistant

While editing a document, click the AI assistant icon on the right side of the editor to open the assistant panel. The panel slides in from the right and appears alongside your document, allowing you to chat with the assistant while continuing to write.

By default, the “Docs Assistant” is used—an assistant optimized specifically for writing. If you need help in a specific domain, you can switch to a custom assistant you’ve created via the top-left corner of the assistant panel.

The assistant can directly edit content within your document.

### Managing Docs

In the Docs list, you can rename documents, create duplicates, copy the full content, or delete them.
