# Resource Library

The LobeHub Resource Library is your personal knowledge hub. Documents uploaded during conversations, AI-generated images, and created drafts are all collected here. The Resource Library strengthens your collaboration with AI, ensuring your accumulated knowledge is no longer scattered but centrally managed and readily accessible.

## Sources of Resources

- Conversation Uploads: Files uploaded during chats with your assistant are automatically saved to the Resource Library. For example, if you upload a PDF for summarization, the file will be stored and available for future use.
- AI-Generated Content: Images created in the drawing module are automatically saved to the Resource Library. You can view, download, and reuse them in conversations or drafts at any time.
- Manual Uploads: You can directly upload files or folders to the Resource Library to actively build your knowledge base. Supported formats include documents, images, videos, audio, and more.
- Draft Creation: Drafts created in the writing module are also stored in the Resource Library for unified management alongside other resources.
- Notion Import: You can import content from Notion into the LobeHub Resource Library, enabling seamless knowledge management across both platforms.
- Accessing the Resource Library: Click the "Resources" icon in the lower-left sidebar of the LobeHub main interface to enter the Resource Library.
- Creating Resource Libraries: Organize your resources by topic, project, or type. Create multiple libraries to keep your content structured and easy to manage.
- Uploading Resources: On the Resource Library page, click "New Resource Library" in the left panel, enter a name, add an optional description, and click to create.
- Uploading Folders: Choose to upload an entire folder to batch upload multiple files at once.
- Connecting Notion: Export documents from Notion, then go to the "Connect Notion" page and import the Notion ZIP file. Once imported, you can edit these documents directly in LobeHub.

## Managing the Resource Library

File Chunking: File chunking splits long documents into smaller text segments and vectorizes each segment. This allows the AI assistant to better understand and retrieve relevant content from your files.

After chunking:

- When you ask a question, the AI can quickly locate the relevant parts of a document instead of processing the entire file.
- Vectorization enables the AI to understand the semantic meaning of the text, not just match keywords.
- The AI only processes relevant chunks, resulting in faster and more accurate responses.

### Batch Operations

Select multiple files and open the menu in the top-right corner to perform batch operations, including moving files to a resource library, chunking multiple files, or deleting them in bulk. \[Image]

### Cross-Feature Collaboration

- Chat + Resource Library: Reference the Resource Library during conversations to let the assistant provide answers based on your knowledge.
- Drafts + Resource Library: Use materials from the Resource Library while writing drafts for more efficient content creation.
- Drawing + Resource Library: Save generated images to the Resource Library to manage all your visual assets in one place.
