 * - `local`   → this machine (in-process; desktop only)
 * - `sandbox` → server cloud sandbox
 * - `device`  → remote device (dispatched to `boundDeviceId`)
 *
 * `local` and `device` stay DISTINCT even when the bound device is this very
 * machine: `device` dispatches through the server gateway, so progress streams
 * to every client (mobile/web can follow the run); `local` is the faster
 * in-process IPC path whose run lives only in this desktop session. Which one
 * to use is the user's observability/latency trade-off — never auto-collapse
 * `device(currentDeviceId)` into the in-process path.
 *
 * Defaults: desktop → `local`, web → `none`. On web `local` isn't available
 * (no local filesystem). A desktop `local` pick pins that desktop's own
 * `deviceId` as `boundDeviceId` (see `useSelectExecutionTarget`), and the
 * server routes such a config to that bound device — so on web we resolve it
 * to `device`, surfacing honestly that it runs on the user's machine (via
 * `lh connect`) instead of masquerading as `sandbox`. This applies to plain
 * agents too, not just heterogeneous CLI agents (LOBE-11473: plain agents used
 * to leak here, showing "cloud sandbox" while the server ran on the device).
 *
 * This upgrade is gated on `deviceRoutingAvailable` (or `isHetero`): the run
 * can only reach the bound device if a device-gateway exists to route it. Web
 * display sites pass `!!serverConfig.agentGatewayUrl` (cloud always has one);
 * a no-gateway self-host has no route, so its bound `local` stays `sandbox`
 * when the provider supports it. An UNBOUND `local` (no `boundDeviceId`) falls
 * back to `sandbox` on web, or to the pending `none` state for device-only
 * providers.
 * Server callers leave `deviceRoutingAvailable` unset — with a gateway they
 * already pass `clientExecutionAvailable: true` and skip this branch, so it is
 * inert server-side and never diverts a no-gateway run away from `sandbox`.
 *
 * Bot triggers (`trigger === bot`) upgrade a `local` target (a bot has no UI
 * to pick a device and `local` in-process IPC is unreachable from the cloud
 * bot server): to `device` when a `boundDeviceId` pins a specific machine,
 * otherwise to `auto` to auto-activate an online device. `none` / `sandbox`
 * are explicit opt-outs and stay.
